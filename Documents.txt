Urban Planning Research Tool – Project Documentation

Overview:
This project is an Urban Planning Research Tool built using Python and Streamlit. 
It helps analyze city-level data such as population demographics, zoning regulations, 
and transportation networks to support better urban planning decisions.

Objectives:
- Analyze census demographic data
- Inspect zoning rules and land-use constraints
- Study transportation connectivity
- Provide an interactive interface for planners and researchers

Datasets:
The datasets used in this project are sourced from Kaggle and stored in CSV format.

1. census.csv
   - City
   - Population
   - Median age
   - Employment rate

2. zoning.csv
   - Zone type
   - Maximum building height
   - Density

3. transport.csv
   - Source location
   - Destination location
   - Distance

Technology Stack:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- CSV datasets

How the System Works:
The Streamlit application reads the CSV files using Pandas and displays the data 
in an interactive web interface. Users can explore urban data visually and 
use it for planning and analysis purposes.

Deployment:
The project is deployed using Streamlit Cloud and connected to a public GitHub repository.

Use Cases:
- Urban planning research
- Smart city analysis
- Academic projects
- Policy evaluation
